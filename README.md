# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The Loan Eligibility Prediction project aims to automate the loan approval process by leveraging machine learning algorithms. In this project, two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, are employed to predict whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on various features.
