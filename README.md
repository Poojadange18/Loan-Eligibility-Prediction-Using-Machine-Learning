# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The Loan Eligibility Prediction project aims to automate the loan approval process by leveraging machine learning algorithms. In this project, two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, are employed to predict whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on various features.
Algorithms Used:

Na√Øve bayes: 

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks, particularly in situations where the features are assumed to be independent. Despite its "naive" assumption of independence, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice and is computationally efficient. It is widely used in text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and other applications.
Decision Tree:

A Decision Tree is a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It makes decisions by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of features. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision based on a specific feature, and each leaf node represents the predicted outcome.
